# Clones if absent; pulls otherwise.
#
# If this was a clone, then it tries to update the repo to the same
# branch as the matterhorn repo (the expectation is that parallel
# changes in the this related repo will have parallel branches).
# Sometimes changes in the matterhorn repo do not have associated
# changes in the this repo; in that case, the "develop" branch is
# tried in this repo, followed by the master branch if there is no
# develop branch.
#
# This is based on the branching strategy for matterhorn and
# associated repos of (1) master is current release, (2) develop is
# where completed work is collected for the next release candidate,
# (3) feature branches are made off of develop, and (4) bugfix
# branches can be made off of either master or develop, and (5) the
# "branch" name can actually be a release tag, and related repos
# should either bear the same release tag or use the head of the
# master branch for their release.
#
# If this was a pull, assume the directory containing the dependent
# repo is already on the branch it should have and just use the pull
# to move to the latest HEAD on that branch.
