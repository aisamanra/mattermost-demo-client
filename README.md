# Chat With the Developers

The Matterhorn developers hang out on the official Mattermost
pre-release server. Stop by to get support and say hello!

[https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/matterhorn](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/matterhorn)

# Quick Start

We provide pre-built binary releases for some platforms. Please see the
release list to download a binary release for your platform that matches
your server version:

https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/releases

To run Matterhorn, unpack the binary release archive and run the
`matterhorn` binary within.  Help is available via the `--help` or
`-h` flag.

    $ matterhorn --help
    $ matterhorn

When you run Matterhorn you'll be prompted for your server information
and credentials. At present `matterhorn` supports only username/password
authentication.

Note: Version `ABBCC.X.Y` matches Mattermost server version `A.BB.CC`.
For example, if your Mattermost server version is `3.6.0` then you
would download matterhorn version `30600.2.4`. See [Our Versioning
Scheme](#our-versioning-scheme) for details.

# Configuring

For configuration options you have two choices:

* Interactive configuration entered on each program run
* Configuration via stored settings in a config file

The first option is useful when trying out the program because you can
get up and running without worrying about making a configuration. Once
you're ready to make your settings persistent, they can be added to
a configuration file. An example configuration file can be found at
`docs/sample-config.ini`. Any settings omitted from the configuration
will be obtained interactively at startup.

When looking for configuration files, matterhorn will prefer
`config.ini` in the current working directory, but will look in the
typical XDG configuration directories (you'll probably want to use
`$HOME/.config/matterhorn/config.ini`) and as a last resort look for a
globally-accessible `/etc/matterhorn/config.ini`.

# Using the Client

The user interface has three main areas:

* Left: list of channels you're in, and list of users in your team and
  their statuses (`+` means online, `-` means away, `Ã—` means Do Not
  Disturb, and an absent sigil means offline)
* Right: messages in the current channel
* Bottom: editing area for writing, editing, and replying to messages

You can use built-in keybindings or `/cmd`-style commands to operate the
client. Keybinding and command help may be obtained in a number of ways:

* The `/help` command within Matterhorn.
* The `F1` key within Matterhorn.
* Running matterhorn with the `-k` argument to get a text table of available keybindings.
* Running matterhorn with the `-K` argument to get a [Markdown table of available keybindings](docs/keybindings.md).
* Running matterhorn with the `-M` argument to get a [Markdown table of available commands](docs/commands.md).

    Note: The latter three commands do not start the client but simply
    print to stdout and exit. The keybindings shown include any user
    overrides from the config files; use the `-i` flag to skip loading
    the local config files and see the Matterhorn default keybindings.

Keybindings may include modifiers such as Control (indicated with a
`C-` prefix) or Meta (indicated with a `M-` prefix). If your keyboard
has an `Alt` key, that will work as `Meta`. If it does not, you may be
able to configure your terminal to provide `Meta` via other means
(e.g. iTerm2 on OS X can be configured to make the left Option key
work as Meta). Keybindings can be customized in the configuration
file; see `/help keybindings` for details.

To join a channel, use the `/join` command to choose from a list of
available channels. To create a channel, use `/create-channel`. To leave
a channel, use `/leave-channel`.

To create a private group chat amongst yourself and other users, use the
`/group-msg` command, e.g., `/group-msg user1 user2`.

To see the members in the current channel, use the `/members` command.

To send a message, type it into the editor and press Enter to send.
To send a multi-line message, toggle multi-line mode with the default
binding `M-e`. Markdown syntax is accepted.

To edit your current message in an external editor (`$EDITOR`), use the
default binding of `M-k`.

To see a live preview of the message you're about to send while you
compose it (e.g. to check on how your Markdown syntax will be rendered),
toggle preview mode with the default binding `M-p`.

To change channels, use `/focus` or one of the default bindings `C-n`
(next channel), `C-p` (previous channel), `C-g` (fast channel switch).

To directly message another user, use `/focus` or `C-g`.

`C-g` channel switching mode does a substring match of the input text on
the channel and usernames; metacharacters `^` and `$` at the beginning
or end of input, respectively, anchor the match in case of multiple
matches. The cursor in this mode is usable with `C-n` and `C-p`.

To switch to the channel you were in prior to the current channel, use
the default binding `M-s` (swap). The most recent channel is marked in
the channel list with a "`<`" indicator.

To switch to the next channel with unread messages, use the default
binding `M-a`.

To quickly show a list of URLs mentioned in the current channel and then
open one in your local browser, use the default binding of `C-o` and
configure the `urlOpenCommand` configuration setting.

To edit, delete, flag, or reply to a message, select a message with
the default binding of `C-s`. Use the default binding of `C-c` to
cancel these operations.

Messages that have been flagged can be viewed with either the `/flags`
command or `M-8`. This view allows you to select and unflag particular
messages, as well.

To enable spell-checking in the message editor, install Aspell and set
`enableAspell` to `True` in your configuration. To override Aspell's
choice of master dictionary, set the `aspellDictionary` option to the
name of the dictionary you'd like to use.

To attach a file to the post being edited, use the default binding of
`C-x`. The window that appears will let you browse the filesystem to
find a file to attach. In this window, `o` opens the selected file with
your URL open command to let you preview your choice, `Enter` enters the
selected directory or selects the current file for attachment, and arrow
keys change selection. Once you've attached a file, you'll see the text
`(1 attachment)` above your message editor. You can attach additional
files or remove existing attachments by pressing `C-x` again.

# Spell Checking Support

Matterhorn uses `aspell` to perform spell-checking of your message
input. To use this feature:

 * Install `aspell` and ensure that your installation includes
   dictionaries corresponding to your `LANG` setting. To check this, ask
   `aspell` to check some input:
   ```
   $ echo stuff | aspell -a
   Error: No word lists can be found for the language "en".
   $ echo $LANG
   en_US
   ```
   If Aspell succeeds, the output will look like this:
   ```
   @(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 (but really Aspell 0.60.6.1)
   *
   ```
 * Set `enableAspell` to `True` in your `config.ini`
 * Enter any message input in the message editor in `matterhorn`. After
   a short delay after you stop typing, misspelled words will turn red.

# Emoji

Matterhorn loads its emoji list (for auto-completion of `:...:`) at
startup. It looks for an `emoji.json` file in the following locations
and in the following order:

* `~/.config/matterhorn/emoji.json`. This option is to support emoji
  list installation and customization.
* `MHBIN/emoji/emoji.json`, where `MHBIN` is the directory containing
  the `matterhorn` binary. This option is to make it convenient to use
  emoji with `matterhorn` from releases.

The `emoji.json` is included in the Matterhorn releases
and is obtained from [the Mattermost web client source
tree](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/utils/emoji.json).

# Building

If you just want to run Matterhorn, we strongly suggest running a binary
release (see above).

If you want to contribute changes to Matterhorn, you'll need to build
it from source. To do that you'll need an appropriate `ghc`/`cabal`
installation (see the latest Travis-CI builds for tested versions).
You'll also need a GitHub account, since our Git submodules are set up
to use SSH with GitHub.

`matterhorn` is built by running the following commands:

```
$ git pull
$ git submodule update --init
$ ./build.sh
```

# Our Versioning Scheme

Matterhorn version strings will be of the form `ABBCC.X.Y` where ABBCC
corresponds to the lowest Mattermost server version expected to be
supported by the release.  For example, if a release supports
Mattermost server version 1.2.3, the ABBCC portion of the `matterhorn`
version will be `10203`.  There may be later versions of the
Mattermost server that are supported (e.g. Matterhorn 50200.X.Y
supports Mattermost server versions 5.2 through at least 5.8).

The `X.Y` portion of the version corresponds to our own version
namespace for the package. If the server version changes, `X.Y` SHOULD
be `0.0`. Otherwise the first component should increment if the
package undergoes major code changes or functionality changes. The
second component alone should change only if the package undergoes
security fixes or other bug fixes.

# Our Design Philosophy

Overall, we strive to build a terminal client that provides the same
basic feature set as the web client. This is reflected in the state
of the client, our issue backlog, and the content of our wiki feature
design discussions.

We intend to add web client features to Matterhorn to the extent that
they can be added sensibly in a terminal setting. Our goal is to do
so in a way that minimizes surprise to web client users migrating to
Matterhorn while also providing the best terminal user experience that
we can think of. That might entail adding the web client features but
changing their designs to ones better suited for terminal use or it
might mean omitting aspects of web client features that rely heavily on
mouse- or DOM-related UI idioms. It might also entail adding web client
features but deviating slightly on specific behaviors.

If you are used to a web client feature and don't see it in Matterhorn,
that's probably because we just haven't gotten to it yet. We would
be happy to hear from people wanting to contribute! If you can't
contribute, search existing issues to see if we already have an issue
for it, or create a new issue and let us know!

# Contributing

If you decide to contribute, that's great! Here are some guidelines you
should consider to make submitting patches easier for all concerned:

 - If you want to take on big things, let's have a design/vision
   discussion before you start coding. Create a GitHub issue and we can
   use that as the place to hash things out. We'll be interested to
   discuss any usability / UI, performance, or compatibility issues.
 - Please make changes consistent with the conventions already used in
   the codebase.
 - We follow a few development practices to support our project and it
   helps when contributors are aware of these. Please see
   `docs/PRACTICES.md` for more information.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does matterhorn support Gitlab authentication?

No. But we would be happy to work with contributors who are interested
in investigating what this would take and/or implementing it. See the
Contributing section for details.

## How can I get Matterhorn to render emphasized Markdown text with an italic font?

In `~/.config/matterhorn/theme.ini`,
```
[other]
markdownEmph.style = [italic]
```
and in `~/.config/matterhorn/config.ini`,
```
themeCustomizationFile: theme.ini
```

This is known to work on `gnome-terminal` version `3.32.2`, VTE version
`0.56.3`; it may work for you, too. Many terminal emulators do not
support italics at all or without various hacks. Let us know what works
for you!

## I enabled italicized text in my theme configuration. Why doesn't it work?

Most terminfo files for typical terminal configurations do not provide
support for italicized text. If your terminal emulator supports italics,
you must enable it in your terminfo database in order to use it in
Matterhorn. For more information, see these links:

* http://www.nerdyweekly.com/posts/enable-italic-text-vim-tmux-gnome-terminal/
* https://medium.com/@dubistkomisch/how-to-actually-get-italics-and-true-colour-to-work-in-iterm-tmux-vim-9ebe55ebc2be
* https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/2.1/FAQ#L355-L383

## I am seeing malformed characters or display corruption when I run matterhorn in my terminal. What could be causing this?

Some terminal emulators cannot handle the extra escaping that occurs
when the URL hyperlinking mode is enabled. Try setting `hyperlinkUrls =
False` in your `config.ini` file.

## Does Matterhorn support graphical emoji?

At present Matterhorn does not reliably support graphical emoji due to
the lack of consistent support for wide Unicode characters in various
terminal emulators. Results may vary, and use of emoji characters may
cause terminal rendering issues depending on the terminal emulator in
use.
